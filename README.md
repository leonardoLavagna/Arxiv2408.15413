## On the Effects of Small Graph Perturbations in the MaxCut Problem by QAOA.
This is the companion repository for the paper "On the Effects of Small Graph Perturbations in the MaxCut Problem by QAOA" available on [https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.15413](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.15413), announced [here](https://leonardolavagna.github.io/posts/2024/08/SYM-QAOA/), and discussed [here](https://lavagnaleo.wordpress.com/2024/08/29/on-the-effects-of-small-graph-perturbations-in-themaxcut-problem-by-qaoa).

### What's in here? 
Here you can find:
- The jupyter notebook we used to get the results.
- The zip file containing all the results we put in the paper (available here for reproducibility).
- The jupyter notebook we used to produce the heuristics and the plots in the preprint.

The code depend on the QAOA implementation we have in our laboratory (see [https://github.com/NesyaLab/qaoa](https://github.com/NesyaLab/qaoa/)) which is based on [qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit), and the library [pynauty](https://github.com/pdobsan/pynauty). This code allows for some flexibility currently not supported by qiskit standard methods. 

Code version `v0.2`. If you happen to use our code, please cite the preprint.
